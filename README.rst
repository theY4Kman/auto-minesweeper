Minesweeper Hints
-----------------

A minesweeper clone with an interface for AI directors.

Now Python 3.5+ only, 'cause I like using type annotations to nudge PyCharm into showing me code hints, so's I don't have to type so much. I have weak hands, give me a break. That's not true, don't believe that â€“ my hands are moderately useful, at least.

*NOTE: The frequency of losses to wins experienced at time of writing is not reflected by the ratio of loss pictures to win pictures. Minesweeper is an unforgiving son of a beast (bitch). Most games are losses, at time of writing.
